# PabloChocobar
Discord bot that suggests unsolved problems from Educational Codeforces rounds & ICPC mirror rounds.

The bot gives the `problem name`, `solved problems/total problems` in the specified range and the `problem link`.

The bot doesn't give random problems on same command, i.e, a problem cannot be skipped. This is to encourage the user to solve all problems (and also to suffer).

## Functionality
The bot currently supports following commands:
- `-help`
